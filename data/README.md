# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

Due to the large sizes, some data have not been added to this directory. Here are the original sources for the data not included.
