In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a version 2.0 of an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on a topic of your choice using [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) or U.S. government open data released on the [data.gov](https://data.gov/) website. See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

The **learning goals** for this project is:

- business intelligence for data science
- study legacy codes and further development
- data cleaning
- data visualization
- systems development/design life cycle
- shiny app/shiny server

## Project Title FiCoH (Find Cozy Home) NYC
Term: Fall 2019

+ Team # 6
+ **FiCoH**: + Team members
	+ Young Sim
	+ Yanyan Liu
	+ Tongyu Wang

+ **Project summary**: While there are piles of listings out there to look at when you go house hunting, it is difficult to get to know the living environment of the area until you actually get to live there. People often end up making a contract for a unit just by looking at the interior and realizing that they do not like the area. There are more to consider than just price and commuting distance. FiCoH NYC will help you find a cozy home in New York City by letting you explore different areas in New York to see how the living environments like safety, pollution level, and even information on childcare centers for those of you with childern.

+ **Contribution statement**: All team members discussed and agreed on the topic of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement. 

+ Young Sim cleaned crime data and generated map visualizations for the safety tab and At a Glance tab. She also generated boxplots for safety tab and environment tab as well as tables in At a Glance tab. She improved ui and server for Shiny App based on the baseline Shiny App for At a Glance tab, safety tab, and environment tab.
+ Yanyan Liu cleaned E-designation data, rodent inspection data, and childcare data and generated map visualizations for environment tab and childcare tab. She improved ui and server for Shiny App based on the baseline Shiny App for user manual tab, environment tab, and childcare tab.
+ Tongyu Wang developed baseline Shiny App and wrote draft for user manual script.
